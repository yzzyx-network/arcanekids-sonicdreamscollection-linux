== PRESS RELEASE via http://hedgehog.exposed/ ==

IN 2013 hacker supergroup “Arcane Kid$” acquired a SEGA DREAMCAST developer kit from ebay.com. Deep in the filescape they unearthed a note from the director of MJSTUDIO, a “message in a bottle” detailing the work of SEGA’s top secret studio which was re-invisioning the future of video gaming.

The Arcane Kid$ salvaged FOUR playable prototypes, some concept art, and countless top-secret SEGA files.
“SEGA squandered MJSTUDIO’s gift to the world… and dissed Sonic fans globally… by burying these games” Arcane Kid$ spokesperson Jo says.

“It’s time to set them free.” Arcane Kid$ has granted HEDGEHOG EXPOSED exclusive rights to what they call the “Sonic Dreams Collection”

/////// A note on the absence of "Knuckles the Echidna"
We reached out to the voice actor for Knuckles but their agent told us to go away, we have no talent, which I don't believe is true.
