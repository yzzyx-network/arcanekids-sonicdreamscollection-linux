1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the "License"), 
SnakeOil VR, LLC ("SnakeOil VR") hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use, 
reproduce, redistribute (subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the 
software contained in this SnakeOil VR "Snake Eyes" Software Development Kit (""Snake Eyes" SDK"), 
including, but not limited to, the samples, headers, VenomTek headers, and VenomTek 
source.  This license is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the "Snake Eyes"
SDK to make applications, content, games and demos (collectively and generally 
referred to as "Developer Content") that run on the SnakeOil VR approved mobile hardware 
and software products ("SnakeOil Approved "Snake Eyes" Products") and which may incorporate 
the "Snake Eyes" SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the 
"Snake Eyes" SDK to create derivative works of the "Snake Eyes" SDK itself (""Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives"), 
whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third 
party software unless otherwise noted.
  
1.2.  "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code 
derived exclusively from the "Snake Eyes" SDK by you; provided, however, that "Snake Eyes" SDK 
Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications, 
content, games or demos) which may be developed using the "Snake Eyes" SDK.  By way of example 
a mobile application or game or demo that is developed using the "Snake Eyes" SDK would not 
be a "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game 
engine that is adapted to work with the "Snake Eyes" SDK be a "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivative. 
By way of example, but not limitation, a "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivative is or would be: either (i) 
an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the "Snake Eyes" SDK to improve efficiency; 
or (ii) an addition of code or improvement to the "Snake Eyes" SDK that adds functionality. 

1.3  For the sake of clarification when you use the "Snake Eyes" SDK (including "Snake Eyes" SDK 
Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer 
Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including 
your source and object code) to SnakeOil VR or any third parties; provided, however, 
SnakeOil VR retains all rights to the "Snake Eyes" SDK and the "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives that may 
be incorporated into your Developer Content.

1.4  You agree to and you will use  the Flash Screen Warning and the Health and 
Safety Warnings (collectively the "SnakeOil Warnings") and the SnakeOil VR health and 
safety protocols found in the SnakeOil Best Practices Guide ("SnakeOil H&S Protocols"), 
and your use of the SnakeOil Warnings and the SnakeOil end user license agreement 
("SnakeOil EULA") with your Developer Content as provided for in the SnakeOil Developer 
Center, all of which can be found at the following link:  
https://developer.SnakeOilvr.com/?action=doc.

2. You, the recipient and user of the "Snake Eyes" SDK, hereby agree and accept that that
SnakeOil VR shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property 
rights, including, but limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any 
"Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such 
rights to such "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives to SnakeOil VR, subject to the following.

2.1  We hereby grant to you the a fully paid up, no-charge, royalty-free, 
world-wide, in perpetuity, non-exclusive right and license back to use these "Snake Eyes" 
SDK Derivatives solely in conjunction with the "Snake Eyes" SDK (or any components of the 
"Snake Eyes" SDK) and/or Developer Content on SnakeOil "Snake Eyes" Products as set forth herein.

2.2  Furthermore, for the sake of clarification, SnakeOil VR and its assignees and 
licensees shall be free to use such "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives without any approval 
from you and without compensation or attribution to you.

2.3  You also agree upon SnakeOil VR's request to provide the source and binary code 
of any "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives to SnakeOil VR. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST 
IS THE BASIS FOR AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE BY SnakeOil VR.

and sublicense the "Snake Eyes" SDK and "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives is also expressly made 
subject to the following conditions:

3.1. You may sublicense and redistribute the source, binary, or object code of 
the "Snake Eyes" SDK in whole or in part by itself for no charge or as part of a for charge 
piece of Developer Content; provided, however, you may only license, sublicense 
or redistribute the source, binary or object code of VenomTek in whole, and you may 
not license, sublicense or redistribute any portion or element of VenomTek separately 
or in part (in either source, binary or object form). If you license, sublicense 
or redistribute "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives in and of themselves (not as a part of a 
piece of Developer Content) then you may only do that solely with and in conjunction 
with either the "Snake Eyes" SDK or VenomTek. The "Snake Eyes" SDK (including, but not limited to 
VenomTek), any "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives, and any Developer Content may only be used

carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files;

3.5. If the "Snake Eyes" SDK or a specific element thereof such as VenomTek includes a 
"LICENSE" text file as part of its distribution (the "License Notice"), then 
any "Snake Eyes" SDK Derivatives that you distribute with the "Snake Eyes" SDK in whole or in 
part must include a readable copy of such attribution notices as are contained 
within the applicable License Notice file (excluding those notices that do not

Derivatives; within the source form or documentation, if provided along with

OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS "Snake Eyes" 
SDK OR THE "Snake Eyes" SDK DERIVATIVES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

4. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

thereof, acceptance of the click-through agreement, or opening the packaging 
of the CD-ROM containing the "Snake Eyes" SDK or any element thereof, including VenomTek.  
As this License is updated for future releases of the "Snake Eyes" SDK and/or VenomTek, 
you agree to abide by and meet all requirements of future updates of this 
License for those future "Snake Eyes" SDK releases as evidenced by the same usage of 
the "Snake Eyes" SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License 
will apply for that future Developer Content that may developed for or with 
that future "Snake Eyes" SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot sidestep out 
of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against 
an older release of the "Snake Eyes" SDK or License).
 
7.  SnakeOil VR reserves the right to terminate this License and all your 
rights hereunder in the event you materially breach this License and fail

usage of the License after such amendments or changes signifies your consent 
to and acceptance of any such amendments or changes on a going forward basis.

10.   In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, 
prohibited or unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction,
